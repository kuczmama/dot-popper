Get ready for some fun! Dot Popper is an exciting game of speed and accuracy where you must race against the clock to hit as many green dots as possible...while avoiding those pesky red dots!
Each time you pop a green dot, you get 1 point plus 1 extra second on the clock...but that green dot turns red! Watch out...each red dot you pop takes 2 seconds off the clock and reduces your score by 2.
Have fun...and get ready to pop some dots!
